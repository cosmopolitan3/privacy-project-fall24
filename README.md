# privacy-project-fall24

This project is for Privacy in a Networked World for the Fall 2024 semester. Our aim is to create a website on Data Colonialism, with several case studies to explain both its reach and impact. Our website defines data colonialism, provides several detailed case studies, and offers potential solutions. By building this website, we hope to inform and educate people on what data colonialism is and how it may be impacting you.
