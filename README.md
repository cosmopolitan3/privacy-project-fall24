# privacy-project-fall24

This project is for Privacy in a Networked World for the Fall 2024 semester. Our aim is to create a website on Data Colonialism, with several case studies to explain both its reach and impact. There will be several pages including a Home, Defining Data Colonialism, Case Studies, Looking Ahead and Resources. By building this website, we hope to inform and educate people on data colonialism and how it may be impacting you.
