    <p> Our modern age of extensive data extraction—whether for operating platforms or powering generative AI—reflects a continuation of colonialism wherein powerful countries and companies gain dominion over populations through their data (Harari, 2024). Long before the emergence of tech giants like GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) and their Chinese counterparts BATX (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiaomi), the advancements of modern science laid the groundwork for Big Tech to leverage Big Data in ways reminiscent of the colonial era. 
    </p>
    <p> By harnessing sophisticated data collection and analysis, powerful countries and companies write the narratives, influence behaviors, and exert control over various aspects of life in these 'colonized' regions, often without their consent or even knowledge. Furthermore, as these companies and governments, located primarily in the West and parts of Asia, upskill their workers, they widen the economic chasm with developing countries. Countries lacking similar resources and technological infrastructure will find their labor forces increasingly devalued and unable to compete. </p>
