        Looking Ahead
    </h1>
   
    <div class="container">

        <p>To tackle the challenges presented by rapid digitization and data power in the Global South, it's important for governments and citizens to understand both the opportunities and risks involved. International bodies like the United Nations Statistical Commission can help guide efforts to address the global data imbalances.</p>
    
        <h2>Actions to Support National Statistical Offices (NSOs)</h2>
        <div class="ahead">
            <ul>
                <p>Identify and Address Data Gaps: Governments must assess data needs and prioritize them accordingly.</p>
                <p>Increase Funding for NSOs: More coordinated donor funding is necessary to strengthen domestic policy priorities.</p>
                <p>Involve Local Stakeholders: NSO leaders and local experts should play an active role in managing data sources and ensuring transparency.</p>
                <p>Focus on Sustainability: International organizations must prioritize long-term sustainability in local data production.</p>
                <p>Establish Clear Guidelines for Public-Private Collaborations: Clear standards should be set for collaborations between the public and private sectors, ensuring data integrity and protecting citizen interests.</p>
            </ul>
        

        </div>
        
        <h2>Broader Government Initiatives</h2>
        <div class="ahead">
            <ul>
                <p>Data-Driven Government Strategies: Governments should adopt policies that leverage data effectively, supported by strong digital governance frameworks.</p>
                <p>Regulate the Tech Sector: A regulatory framework for the tech industry can ensure responsible industry practices.</p>
                <p>Localize Data Storage: Storing data domestically can help ensure more equitable control, where regional regulations can balance data flow concerns.</p>
            </ul>

        </div>

        
    
        <p>These actions are crucial in preventing exploitative data practices and addressing long-standing inequities. A truly transformative "data revolution" can only occur if it empowers those who have historically been excluded from the digital benefits.</p>
