        Muslim Immigrants in Catalonia Spain
    </h2>
    <p>
        The case of data colonialism in Catalonia, northern region in Spain, highlights the discrimination faced by the Muslim population, particularly through the lens of AI and automated decision-making (ADM) tools used in welfare and surveillance systems. Researchers Aitor Jiménez and Ainhoa Nadia Douhaibi explore how the expansion of a digital welfare and surveillance program reflecting an “Islamophobic Consensus”. In Catalonia, the government employs an extensive monitoring system that targets Muslims, often interpreting vague online activities as signs of radicalization (Jimenez & Douhabia, 2024). Such surveillance can lead to severe repercussions, including denial of citizenship applications based on misinterpreted actions or affiliations. Some of the so called transgressions can be as simple as misinterpreted social media posts (Couldry & Mejia, 2024). This operationalization of the Islamophobic Consensus illustrates how ADMs reinforce existing racial biases, intertwining with colonial punitive strategies to control and govern young racialized Muslims, often labeling them as "risky" or "dangerous."

        Smart Borders Case and Palantir
    </h2>
    <p>
        Palantir, is a public large cap company that specializes in data integration and analytics for government agencies and other organizations. It has grown to be the vital player in the evolving landscape of data governance, becoming integral to the operation of Smart Borders and broader national security strategies.

    <p>
        Smart Borders is a strategy for border control and immigration management that makes use of data analytics to enhance surveillance and enforcement. It includes automated visa application review, independent surveillance with drones, intelligent video systems for tracking people, leveraging of biometric data (i.e. facial recognition and fingerprinting), and location-tracking devices. Smart Borders aim to maximize border processes and improve security, but they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy, human rights, and the potential for increased discrimination against particular groups.  Palantir serves as an example of a concentration and abuse of power in immigration and border control. Palantir plays a major role in facilitating and enhancing state surveillance, contributing to a form of data colonialism. Its systems connect varied databases that previously operated in silos, generating comprehensive profiles that serve to surveil and control individuals at border crossings. This approach not only intensifies the surveillance of migrants but also pushes migrants to use more dangerous routes, driving up fatalities.

        Palantir's predictive capabilities allow governments, particularly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to take preemptive measures against people based on forecasts of potential criminal behavior, which criminalizes the mere presence of certain groups. Ultimately, Palantir’s technologies reconstruct the framework of governance, embedding itself as a permanent infrastructure for decision-making in immigration policy, thereby exemplifying how corporate and governmental data practices intertwine in the exploitation of vulnerable populations (Couldry & Mejia, 2024).
